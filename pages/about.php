                    A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of people. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.

                    All pandemics start as localized disease outbreaks that then begin spreading rapidly, and eventually around the world. Experts say that the likelihood of pandemics has gone up due to increased global travel and urbanization. As people live in more densely populated areas and are able to more easily travel around the world, disease can spread much more quickly.

In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers in Wuhan, China started reporting something strange to the WHO office in China in late 2019. They were noticing a cluster of unusual double lung infections with no clear cause.
</p>
<p>
All the early cases of the COVID-19 could be traced back to one place: the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. This market is known as a “wet market” where live fish, meat, and wild animals are sold. These markets can create an ideal breeding ground for new viruses.
